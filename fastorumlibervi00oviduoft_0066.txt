The story about the Bear varies, but Ovid (11. 1 5 3) tells it thus:

Callisto, daughter of Lycaon, an Arcadian king, was beloved by
Iuppiter (Zeus) to whom she bore a son. Iuno (Here) in her jealousy
changed her into a bear, and her son one day saw her and chased her. He
was just about to slay her when Iuppiter interposed, and changed the She-
bear into the Bear Constellati0n‚ and her son into the Bear-warden or
Arctophylax (also called Bootes, the brightest star of which is Arcturus).
Ovid here makes his lines still more obscure by calling the son Lycaon,
the narne of his grandfather.

The Bear never sets, being too near the pole (in these latitudes)= So
Ovid means, in plain English: ‘ On 7 June Arctophylax sets (at sun-
rise)‚ and the Bear’s XVatcher is thus removed’. (The true morning
setting is 28 May, the apparent 10 June: so this is fairly accurate. See
Introduction, Astronomy).

237. The Fishers⁷ Festival (Ludi Piscatorii), held on 7 June in
fields near the Tiber (in whose honour they were, 238); and the day
was a holiday among the men of that craft. [Campus usually means the
Campus Martius: but Festus tells us the feast was held on the other
(W.) side of the riven]

240.⁴ cibis, ‘bait’.

[ut—248· 8 June: Festival of the Temple of Mens and its
history]

²41· After the (lisastrous battle (in 217 Β. C.) of Lake Trasimene,
in the second Punic XVar, where the consul Flaminius and his army
perished (leto consulis, 243), the Romans vowed several temples3 among
these, the praetor Otacilius vowed one to ‘Mind ³, Mens, which was
built two years later on the Capitol (Liv. XXII. ιο). Ovid says that
this piety succeeded, and their affairs were managed better afterwards
(246).

242. The Romans always called the Carthaginians ‘faithless'.
There is no evidence that Hannibal ever broke his word, while the
Senate on more than one occasion were shamelessly treacherous. Yet
Livy (ΧΧῙ. 4), speaking of Hannibal, attributes to him ‘perfidia plus-
quam Punica’.

243. rebellaras, lit. ‘renewed the war’, but it has the association of
rcvolll'ng connected with it, and suggests that the second Punic War was
a rising of the conqucrctl.

244. Mimas, strictly ‘Moor’ (Morocco and Algiers): but used
loosely of Asricans.

246. illa, Mens. Cf. note on ²4¹·
