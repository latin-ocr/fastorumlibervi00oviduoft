JNTRODUCTJON. 7

Amores, the Heroides (or ‘ Love-Lctters of the Heroines‚' Medea,
Sappho, Sec.) and the ‘Art of Love.’ Then carne the Remcdm
Amoris and Nux. Then the Metamorphoses, a long work of 1 5
books in hexameters: it consists of Legends of Transformaffions,
without any special connection. It may have been effective to
recite to a Roman audience, in parts : but it is not to be called
an epic, though apparently aspiring to be one. Then the xli
books of Fasti, or ⁴ Versified calendar,⁷ a book sor each month :
of which only six, however, remain. In exile, as we have said,
he wrote the Tristia, or ‘ Elegies of Lament' and ⁴ Letters from
Pontus.' There are besides one or two minor works extant,
and some which are lost ε of the latter a tragedy on ‘ Medea’ is
the most famous.

As to the date of the Fasti, it is probable that the six books
we have were all written before he left Rome: for ever. if he
could have had the necessary materials at Tomi, he could
scarcely have had the desire or the energy to continue a work
intended to glorify the Rome which he had lost and the
Emperor whom he had grievously offended. One or two
passages, it is true, must have been written at Tomi, as IV. 82
(me miserum! Scythico quam procul illa solo est! &C.): but
both the general tone, the absence of any rnention of the Fasti
in the Epistles frorn Tomi, the language used about Caesar, and
many minor indications (cf. VI. 666), shew that the work was
practically written before, and no doubt dedicated to Augustus,
to whom allusions are frequent.

However in A. D. 14 Augustus died. Ovid had no hope
from Tiberius, his successor, of being suffered to return from
banishment.

But in 16 the jealousy of Tiberius recalled the victorious
Germanicus (his adopted son) from Germany, and sent him to
the East. Germanicus was known to be a cultivated man : and
it was then probably that Ovid recast his first book into its
present shape, and prefaced it with a laudatory addi-ess to
Germanicus. The passage in lv. 80, alluded to above, was then
probably written. But most of the allusions to Augustus are left
unaltered.
