[769—784. 24 June: Anniversary os the defeat of Syphax, also of

the Metaurus victory. Festival of Fors Fortuna, founded by Servius
Τ ullius]

769. At the close of the second Punic War, Scipio (the great
Africanus) obtained the aid of Masinissa, Numidian prince, against
Syphax, king of the western Numidians. After buming Syphax’s camp,
Masinissa and the Roman legatus Laelius pursued him to Cirta and
took him prisoner. This was in ²03 Β. c.

770. Hasdrubal, brother of Hannibal, marched (207 8.(3.) into
Italy to join his brother; but was met by the Romans and defeated at
the famous battle of Metaurus, where his army and camp were anni-
hilated.

Livy says (XXVII. 49) that when he found all was lost, he spurred his
horse into the midst of a Roman cohort, and, as was worthy of Hamilcar’s
son and H annibal’s brother, died fighting.

Ovid puts the suicide in a slightly different form.

773. There were three temples of Fors Fortuna at Rome: this one,
founded by Servius Tullius (according to tradition), was on the right
bank of the Tiberz at the sixth milestone. The festival was 24 June, and
it was, as we see, a day os merry-making among the lower classes and
slaves.

[785—-790, 26 June. Rising of the belt of Orion3 and the solstice.]

785. The connection of this with the last, by the idea of drunken
revellet returning from the feast and then remembering it was two days
to the rising of the belt of Orion, is unusually artificial and frigid‚ even
sor Ovid. For Astronomy, see Introduction, p. 16.
