(4) and (7). The true evening rising is 10 June: so (4) is
right, (7) a weck wrong.

(6) The actual morning rising of Orion's arm was 16 June:
but Ovid says it was the evening rising, and is wrong.

(8) The apparent evening rising of Ophiuchus was 19
April: but Ovid is probably confusing it with the true morn—
ing sellz‘ng, which was on 21 June. In either case, wrong.

(9) The true morning rising of the Belt was 21 June: so
Ovid is five days wrong.

We observe therefore here :

a. In no case does he say whether it is the true or the
apparent time he is speaking of: though it is some-
times one, sometimes the other.

b. In two cases he gives a double date, which is absurd.

c. ln two cases he confuses the morning with the even-
ing, (6) and (8).

d. In one case (8) he confuses the setting with the
rising.

e. In four cases, even where he means the right phe-
nomenon, the date is wrong.
