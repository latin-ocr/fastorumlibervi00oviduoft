DEAN OF PETERBOROUGH.
¹¹ ll zs a'iſjicnlt lo comuoena' too highly this excellent series.—Guardian.

‘⁶ J he modesty of the general title of tlu's series has, we believe, lea¹
many to misunderstand its character and underrate its value- The books
are well suited for study in the upper forms of our best schools, but not
theless are they adaptea' to the wants of all Bz‘ble students who arc not
specialists. ch doubt, indeed, whether any of the numerous popular
commentaria recently z'ssued in this country will be found more ser-

vz'ceablefor general use.'’—Acaderny.
