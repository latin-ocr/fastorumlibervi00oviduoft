10 INTRODUCTJON.

ξ 4. The Rcsormalion of the calendar.

One of the greatest services rendered by Julius Caesar to the
Empire and the world was the reformation of the Calendar.
Before his time the year consisted of 355 days, and every two
years an intercalary month was inserted (between the 23rd and
the 24th of February) of 22 or 23 days. This process made the
year too long, and as the error of course mounted up it became
observable that the nominal seasons no longer coincided with
⁴ the actual ones. The regulation of the calendar was in the
hands of the pontifices, and they accordingly exercised their
right of altering the intercalation to suit the solar year. But
during the later years of the republic their administration, like
every other, became incapable and corrupt3 and they used to
lengthen or shorten the calendar to serve or spite some
magistrate or taxfarmer who chanced to have won their favour
or hate. Add to this the complete disorganization of everything
during the civil wa1·s; a'nd by the time of Julius Caesar we
find the norninal year was more than 2 months in advance of
the solar seasons. Thus Caesar in his history of the civil war
after describing(111. 6) how the fleet set sail on the 31st of Decem· .
ber says three chapters further on (ΙΙΙ, 9) ‘the winter. was now
approaching'! XVe are not surprised to be told by Suetonius
(Caes. 40) that ‘the harvest festivals did not >coincide with the
summer nor the vintage with the autumn.'

Caesar having obtained supreme power set himself, among
other reforms, to put this confusion straight. He had mastered
some knowledge of astronorny, sufficient for his purpose, and
obtained the aid of the philosopher Sosigenes. In B.C. 46,
which had already received the intercalation of 23 days in
February, he added 67 days in two intercalary months inserted
between November and December. Cicero writing to Ligarius
(Fam. VI. 14) refers to this arrangement, when he says he visited
Caesar ‘a. d. ν. Kalendas intercalares priores,' i.e. Nov. 26, or
‘five days (we should say four) before the first of the first
