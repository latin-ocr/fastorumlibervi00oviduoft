Livy (lx. 30) gives the story os this persecution of the Flute-players
as follows :

The flute-players, being forbidden by Appius Claudius and Plautius
the censors to feast in the temple of Iuppiter (an old right of theirs)‚
seceded to Tibur. The Senate sent to ask the Tiburtines to manage that
they should return. The Tiburtines accordingly asked them to a feast,
made them drunk, and sent them back to Rome in waggons, where
they awoke next morning in the sorum. It was agreed that they should
remain, the right be restored to them, and the annual festival and
license of roaming through the city be given to them.

in praise of the dead sung by the praeficae or hired women-mourners.
