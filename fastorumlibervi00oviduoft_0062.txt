cackling of some geese to find the Gauls just scaling the citadel: he
hastily roused his comrades and drove them back.

In 384 Manlius, having espoused the cause os the poor and oppressed
plebeians, was virulently attached by the patricians ; the cry of aspiring
to be king was successfully raised, and he was convicted of treason and
executed by being hurled from the Tarpeian clisf of the Capitol. Thus
as Livy (VI. 20) says, ‘the same place was the monument of his signal
glory and his death ⁹

192. The Porta Capena was a gate in the old Servian wall, just
below the Caelian hill. Not sar from here there was a cloister (tecta
via) to the temple of Mars. This was the temple srom which on the

rides shall be Rome’s brightest day ': again, ‘ from Castor in the forum
to Mars without the wall’: also Liv. lx. 46). The first of June is the
Commemoration-day of this temple, and that of Tempestas, below.

Romans first took to the naval service: and it was natural that a special
temple of Tempestas should then be wanted. The Mediterranean has
very violent squalls.

196. ‘The taloned bird of Jove ' is of course the eagle. The refer-
ence here is to the constellation of the Eagle, which rose at sunset on the
first of June.

[197—199. June 2. The Hyades rise.]

197. Hyades [ὕω, ‘to rain ’], so called because they were supposed
to bring wet weather: but this was probably connected rather with
their morning setting than their morning rising, as the former was in
November.

Zodiac signs) contained the Hyades in its forehead.
