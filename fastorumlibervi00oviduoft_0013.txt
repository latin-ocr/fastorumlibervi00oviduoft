INTROD (JCTJON. ¹» 9

one of the greatest works ofJulius Caesar, (as is explained fully
in the next semion), to reform the errors and confusion into

which the priestly management had brought it. To the com-
pletion and establishment of this reform Augustus himself had
contributed. The poet's subject was therefore in two ways
appropriate to the time. It was also eminently suited to his
genius. He was incapable of a sustained poetical effort, or a
grand conception, like Vergil's Aeneid: his ‘ Metamorphoses’ are

clear proof of this. His strength lay in neatness of expression,
in light and graceful writing, in simple clear and rapid narrative.

The desultory nature of his subject, requiring ingenuity to avoid
tedious repetition, and giving scope to his story-telling faculty,
was therefore not merely no obstacle, it was an advantage to
him. And this is why, in spite of the seemingly unpromising
subject, no work of his has been more read, or more famous.
The Fasti is accordingly a ‘versified calendar! Each Book
treats of one month ; and our book being the sixth contains the
account of June. Ovid as far as possible explains the calendar-
signs attached to each day: gives a narrative of the events
commemorated, the founding of temples, the thanksgiving for
victories‚ the stories of the gods or heroes worshipped, and the
ceremonies in use. He is especially fond of tracing back the
origin of names and usages : such explanations giving scope to
his ingenuity and inventiveness, for of scientific antiquarian
research he of course has no idea. He also gives astronomical
information3 and relates the rising and setting of different
constellations on different days. Presumably this is done with
the view of being useful, as such a calendar would be, to
sarmers and sailors. It may however have been simply that·
a calendar would not have been complete without it¹; and
that it was a kind of subject well adapted to his purpose, as
it enabled him to bring in the endless legends, chiefly of Greek
origin, connected with the stars. AnyhOW, the astronomy was ¹
not a scientific success ; as will be explained below, (ξ 6).

¹ Julius Caesar’s Calendar apparently contained some astronomical
notices.
