73. possedit, ‘has occupied’ (possidere). socio is explained by 18.
See note.

75. origine, abl. of cause, ‘from the month’s origin’‚ i. e. from the
fact that the month draws its name srom iuniores.

79. nomine, ‘on account of’. ‘sor sake of': a not uncommon use in
Latin, thus, ‘tuo nomine gratulabantur’, ‘on your account ', Cic. Phil.
ι. 12. 30. The metaphor is very probably (like ours) from money
dealings‚ as ‘nomen‘ is a person's name or account in the creditor's
books.

8ο. The allusion is to the story of Cacus and Hercules, told 1. 54 3,
Verg. Aen. V111. 185. Cacus, son osthe fire-god Vulcan (which explains
81), was a monster who lived 'm a cave on the Aventine hill at Rome.
Hercules <ame that way, with the oxen of the three-headed Geryon3 and
Cacus, while he was asleep, stole his cattle, dragging them by their tails
into the cave. The lowing os the oxcn betrayed the theft, and Hercules
chased C. into his cave, tore it open and slew him in spite of his fiery
breath. The splendid passage in Vergil should be read.

83. dzgressz't ab annis, ‘divided by their years', i. e. into older and
younger. The ages, according to the Servian arrangement, were 17—46

88. senum, i.e. Allaz'us from maiores. The fuller account, v. 55.

90. pietas, ‘love' of kindred, being so sacred: regular meaning.
Thus Aeneas from his goodness towards his father (as well as the gods)
is called pius always in the Aeneid.

91. Concordia. One of the most famous temples at Rome (at N.W.
end of forum) was dedicated to Harmony, in 367 Β. c.‚ when the
patricians and plebeians were ‘reconciled' by the Licinian laws, admitting
plebs to the consulship. Augustus had restored ‘harmony' all over the
empire, as his triumph brought to an end the century of civil wars
and troubles. So she is fairly called the ‘Spirit and Work of the Peace-
sul Ruler’, 92·

92. nexa comas, common poetical construction sor nexis comis, ‘her
hair twined’. The construction is remarkable, as the accusative is re-
tained, though the verb is passive. It is probably an imitation of Greek,
some of the instances resembling the Greek passive use (ἐπιτετραμμένος
τὴν ἀρχήν ‘entrusted with the rule') and some the middle (προβεβλημένος
