15—16. contulit, ‘compared'. The reference is to the famous
judginent of Paris. He was son of Priam, king of Troy: and when at
a banquet of the gods an apple inscribed ‘to the sairest’ had been
thrown in by Eris (strise), and the three goddesses Here, Athena,
and Aphrodite (see list of gods) could not agree which was to have
it: they referred the decision to Paris, who decided sor Aphrodite.
Hence came the troubles of the Trojan war, ending in the sack of
Troy, 100. The whole story is told by Tennyson in Oenone.

18. arce lovis. The Capitol at Rome has two summits, and when
both are mentioned they are regularly called Arx Capitoliumque, the
former (prob.) lying N.E., and the latter W. But often, as here, either
name is used sor both summits. In this temple of Iuppiter, which was
on the Capitol proper, there were three chapels or cells, one sor Iuppiter
in the centre, and Minerva and Iuno on the right and left. The old and
famous temple had been burnt 82 13.C.‚ but restored magnificently
by Sulla and (on Sulla’s death) Lutatius Catulus: the later building was

ing) is called srorn the name of iuvenes ': so below 65 sqq.
