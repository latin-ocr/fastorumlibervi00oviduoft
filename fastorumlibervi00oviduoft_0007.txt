PREFATORY NOTE.

THIS Edition, being prepared for the use of those Students
who are not sar advanced in Latin, does not aim at doing more
than supplying in a small compass such help to the thorough
knowledge of this book as it is probable would be most useful

for all students possess one, and derive much benefit from its
careful use, both in becoming acquainted with the history os
meanings of words, and also in the exercise of that judgment
which is required to select the right meaning. On the other
hand historical and mythical allusions are explained in the
notes, as many students might find it difficult to make them out
otherwise. Great care also has been taken to notice all the
grammatical usages which might offer any difficulty, and to
classify them clearly, and to enable the learner, by means of an
Index (and Scheme of the uses of the Subjunctive), to compare
and distinguish the various usages. The reader’s attention has
also been drawn here and there to the special peculiarities of
style.

The book being full of allusions to temples‚ buildings, hills,
roads, &c.‚ in Rome, it has been thought best to prepare a small
sketch-map, containing all the places or buildings alluded to in
the book. The scale of the Map has rendered it desirable to omit
all details, except those which are mentioned in the Text. This
will make the Map much clearer, and easier to use. The lead-
ing features have obviously been retained.

The Text adopted has been mainly that of Rudolph Merkel,
Leipzig, 1876. In one or two places I have however adopted
