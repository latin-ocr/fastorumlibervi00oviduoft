vx.] N OTES. 8 7

[mr—794·- 27 June. Festival-day of the Temple of the Lares, and
of Iuppiter Staton]

791. Lucifero subeunte, i.e. after Ovid's manner ⁸ on the next day'.

Lares. The Sacred Way, approaching the sorum srom the SAV„
mounts a slight rise. On the top stands now the arch os Titus, and this
part was called Summa Sacra Via. To the lest, on the Palatine side,
stood the Sacellum Larum, a little further came the cross-road leading to
the chief gate of the Palatine, close to which stood the old temple of
Iuppiter Stator. This, according to the tradition (Liv. 1. η), was
vowed by Romulus in the Sabine war, if he stayed the ssight, and an
altar (and afterwards a temple) was built upon the spot.

792. There were small shops in the Sacra Via, and we may sup-
pose srom this line that the people who sold flower chaplets had their
stalls here.

[795—796. 29 June. Commem.-day of Temple os Quirinus]

795. i.e. three days remain, or as we should say ‘ two ’z it is the in-
clusive method of counting, which strikes one especially when· the number
is small. 29 June is a. d. 111. Kal. JuL, and so he says there are three
days lest.

Parcae are the Fates; Clotho, Lachesis, Atropos.

796. trabea, 37 5.

The old Sabine god Quirinus was identified with Romulus: and
his temple was on the S.E. side of the Quirinal, towards the Viminal.

[767—812. 30 June. Festival of the Temple of Hercules and the
Muses. Clio gives the poet an account of it.]

798. Pierides, old Greek name for the nine Muses: said to have been
from a place Pieria near Mt Olympus.

The ‘Aedes Herculis Musarum ⁹, as it was called, was built by
Fulvius Nobilior, who defeated (Liv. XXXIX. 5) the Aetoliam, B.e. 187.
It was restored by L. Marcius Philippus (son of the Marcius consul 56),
who married Atia, an aunt of Augustus (matertera Caesaris, 809). His
daughter Marcia (802) was married to a friend of Ovid'S. The temple
lay between Circus Flaminius and the river. The genealogy is confused
by the fact that Marcius Philippus the father, consul 56, married the
elderAlz‘a, Augustus' mother, when her first husband Octavius was dead.

addite summa, ‘ put an end ¹.

800. i.e. to whom Iuno at last gave way (do manus by obvious
metaphor from a prisoner begging quarter), and allowed him aplace in

Heaven.
