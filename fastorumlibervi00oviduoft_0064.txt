and probably from the old Euboean colony of Cumae in Campania (hence
called Cumaean, or, as here, Euboicus) : the old story was that the Sibyl
herself offered nine books for sale to king Tarquin; being refused, she
burnt three, offcring the rest for the same price. After a second refusal
she came back again, having burnt three more, and the remaining three
were purchased for the original sum. They were kept strictly secret,
and were consulted in time of trouble by order of the Senate. When the
temple of Iuppiter was burnt in 82 (cf. 18), a new Sibylline collection was
made and kept in the restored temple.

quod munus, ‘this honour’ of being enshrined here.

211. ⁴ The time of the honour (i. e. festival of the temple) is the day
before the nones '.

The nones were the 9th day (or 8th‚ as they counted inclusively, and

October, when they were on 15th. Thus the Ides of June are 13th‚
nones 5th, and this day 4th.

213. Semo, Sancus, or Dius Fidius [clearly ‘the god of Faith or
Honour’, from fides or sancio] was a very ancient Sabine deity, whose
temple was on the N. W. edge of the Quirinal hill. It contained many
old relies, and among others a wooden shield covered with oxhide, on
which was written in old characters a treaty between Tarquin the Proud
and Gabii.
