⁵17¹. ⁸ Its very roundness keeps the orb poised, and there is no pro-
Jection to overbalance any part': they conceivcd the tendcncy lo Jizll
counteractcd by its symmetrical shape, there being nothing to make it
heavier on one side than another. See 275.

²7²· premat, subj. of purpose, final.

274. latus, ‘side' os the universe.

²75· convexa, ‘spherical’2 is the shape had been irregulan there
would have been more weight in one direction: and thus the centraliOr
(and so the balance) would have been spoiled.

277. Archimedes the great mathematician of Syracuse (287—212
B. c.)‚ constructed a globe repre'senting the universe, with the heavenly
bodies made to move inside: something like what we call an orrery.

279. Being a sphere and in the centre‚ it is symmetrically placed
with reference to the outside sphere.

282. tholus (a Greek word), the round dome at the top of Vesta’s
temple.

283. virginibus ministriv, ‘with maidens to attend her '. Sec 44,
where the construction is explained.

285. Ops, the Italian goddess os Produce or Fertility‚ imagined as
the wife os Saturnus [SA- ‘sow '], the god originally of seed or sowing.
When the Greek mythology was known to the Romans, an identifica-
tion took place of the various divinities, and the Greek legends became
inextricably interwoven with the old Roman rustic notions. Thus
Saturn was identified with Κρόνος, whose daughters were Here (Iuno).
Demeter (Ceres) and Hestia (Vesta): and even their mother Rhea was
identified with Ops. Osten the names alone remain to shew the original
diss‘erence of denies, the more imaginative Greek stories about them
being fully adopted.

288. viri, gen. aster adj. 259.

293. remittit nec capit, i. e. is neither fertilized nor fertile, neither
receives seed nor gives produce: semina in two slightly different (though
both natural) senses. ’

²94· comites virginitatis, ‘comrades of her maidenhood’, i. e.
‘ maidens like herself ’.

295. This refers to Book 111. 45, where Ovid said, ‘Vestae simu-lacta
seruntur virgineas oeulis opposuisse manns', as though there were a
statue: an odd mistake, which he now eorrects.
