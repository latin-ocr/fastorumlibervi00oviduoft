4 PREFATORY NOTE.

the corrections of other editors or scholam, such as Madvig,
Bentley, and l'eter.

The book which has been most useful to me in the prepara-
tion os the notes has been Ovid's Faslisic'r die Sclzule erklc'z'rt,
von Hermann Peter, Leipzig, 1874 z an admirable commentary
which with its Critical Appendix supplies nearly every need of
the reader of Ovid.

Ι have also consulted on many points Merkel’s Prolegomena
to Ovid's Fasti (Berlin, 1841), a learned and exhaustive but
needlessly tedious book.

For the topography of Rome, and sor help in constructing
the Map, I have been indebted to the magnificent work on
‘Rome and the Campagna‚' by the Rev. Robert Bum, of Trinity
College‚ Cambridge. The constant use I have made of it
has only brought out more clearly to me the extreme accu-
racy and thoroughness with which it is written.

Ι have given two Indices : an Index of grammar and general
matters ς and an Index os names. The latter has been thought
desirable, owing to the large number of allusions in the book.

[N. B. In one or two places expurgations have been necessary, and
I have omitted the unfit passages, altering occasionally a word or two,
to keep the connexion clear. In all cases the original numbers have
been retained, as otherwise there might be a difficulty about references]
