56 FA S TI. [Lm

Observe σίήαένε, e short. This is the old form of the verb, and sur-
vives in poetry, where it is convenient: thus we find fervere, tergere,
fulgere, διε. The perfects vidi, sedi, movi, δια, are evidences of the
same fact in other verbs where the short present exists no longer.

141. carmine, ‘ by a charm’. The Marsian or Sabine women were
reputed great in spells and incantations. Compare Horace's three
famous poems about the witch Canidia (Epoa'. V. XVII„ Sat. 1. viii), where
he professes to believe ‘caputque Marsa dissilire nenia’, ‘the head is
torn asunder with the Marsian spell’.

142. Sense: ‘whether they are really birds, or hags changed by
witchcrast ’.

143. Proca, one of the fabulous kings of Alba Longa.

in illis quinque diebus, the regular idiom sor ‘within the last five
(lays ‘, ‘within five days from then ² : so ⁴ hoc biennio' (Cic. Sczp. Sam.
a) ‘within two years from now '.

146. vagit, ‘eries ' z srorn the sound (wa !).

149. qm'dfizceret? ‘what was she to d0?’ This is the past deli-
berative. qm'cz'saciam? ‘ what am Ι to do?' is the primary delibera-
tive (the subjunctive being really the jussive put as a question‚sacias,
‘ you must do ' ι ⁶ quz'dfizcz'am, ‘ what must I d0?’) : it is sound in the
past sorin, commonly when indirect (nesciebat quid jaceret, ‘he did not
know what to do ⁷) and rarely direct, as here, when the past embarrass-
mentis put dramatically.

olim (from olle, old form of ille) prop. ‘at that time '. So used both
past and future : and often, as here, of imaginary cases, in similes. We
should say ⁴ ofttimes ². [-im is old locative termination, and appears in
enim, raptim, hinc, δια]

155. arbutea. The arbutus or strawberry-tree (sound in many gar-
dens in S. England) is common in Italy.

156. notat, ‘marks ⁷, ‘ makes signs ’.

158. cruda [prop. ⁸ hard ', cs. crustum, κρύ-ος, κρύσταλλον], ‘raw’.

bimenstre, with -e for the regular ῑ, a bye-form adopted no doubt for
its convenience. The complex rules in the grammar sor the third declen-
sion of nouns (and the corresponding adjectives) shew the constant tend·
ency to corrupt ῑ into e. So perenne, 111. 654.

161. fibra, prop. ‘thread ’ [fid- ‘to split] ⁵, so ‘entrail’.

164. assint, subj. because the sentence is orat. obliq. after vetat.

165. Amalis, 129.
