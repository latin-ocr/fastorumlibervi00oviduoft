In popular language when we speak of a star rising, we
mean a phenomenon which rccurs every 24 hours. If a star
rises one night, it also rises the next, and so on. The phe-
nomenon here spoken of is not a daily, but a yearly one. When
it is stated that on such a day the Pleiades rz'se in tlte morning,
the meaning is that on that day the Pleiades rise with the sun,
that is, at the moment of sunrise. This can only happen once
in the year. So the day when a star sets in llle morning· is the
day when it sets at sunrise; and similarly the evenz'ng rising
and Setting mean the rising and setting at sunset. It is clearly
of the first importance to distinguish whether it is at sunrise or
sunset. There is no doubt that in the Fasti these are occa-
sionally confused.

2. It is necessary to distinguish the true rising srom the
apparent or laeliacal rising.

As long as the sun is up, the stars cannot be seen: and
when we speak of a star rising at szmm'se or suaset we mean
in the twilight, α little bqfore smwise, or a little after sunset.
In the rustic almanacks this alone would be entered, as this
alone would be useful. But it was not difficult sor even the
earliest astronomers to calculate the true rising, or the day
when the star rose exaetly at sunrise or sunset. The Greek
astronomer Geminus (c. 80 Rc.) knows all about it, and in
many of the more elaborate calendars this would be the rising
intended.

This distinction Ovid never mentions, and he plainly has no
idea of it, quoting his authorities without suspicion that the two
differ from each other, and that he ought to know which he is
talking of.

3. The calculations and observations made elsewhere (in
Greece, Egypt, &c.) would have to be corrected, if they were
to be used at Rome, for differences of latitude.

Of this Ovid knows nothing.

4. Owing to a slight movement of the earth’s axis (Pre-
cession of the Equinoxes), the observations true for a certain
time, say 500 ¹B.C. would be no longer true in Ovid's day. Thus
