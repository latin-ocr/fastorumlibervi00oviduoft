395—416. [Oi-igin of the custom of the Matrons walking barefoot to
the temple of Vesta. MSS. read illa qua: i.e. illa (adv., orig. via under-

306. The Vsa Μηνᾶ went from the Velabrum, a lower district near
the river, past the N.W. side of Palatine‚ round its N. corner, (so
approaching close to the sorum, 396) and along its N.E. face. See
Map.

309. vicina loci, rare use of gen. aster vicinus, perhaps a Greek
imitation: ‘ when near the spot she saw me '.

401. This story points to a tradition which is one among many
indications that in old days the Tiber water was much higher than in
recent times, and much of the ground about, that in historic times was
dry, was once lake or swamp. Thus the valley between the Palatine
and Aventine (Circus Maximus 405), the valley between the Palatine
and Capitol (Velabrum 405), the lacus Curtius in the forum, (403), the
marsh in the Campus Martius (Palus Caprea), are all probablybold
swamps fed by Tiber water. The myths of Vertumnus who turned
back the flood (410), and Romulus and Remus being floated ashore on
the Palatine slope, are other signs of the same thing. (Burri, p. 21, 599.)

402. fossa, ‘ a hollow’, llere natural, properly artificial.

redundatis, special poetic use of the passive, though the verb is pro·
perly intrans. ‘to overflow ’.

403. There are two stories given by Livy for the origin of lacus
Curtius.- (1) 1. 12: in the old days the Sabines from the Capitol and
the Romans from the Palatine met in the valley between to fight: the
Sabine leader Metius Curtius, being defeated, plunged his horse into
the swamp and so escaped. This was on the site os the sorum Romanum,
(2) VH. 6: a huge cavity opened in the forum B. C. 362, and the augurs
said that if Rome was to be saved, ‘that for which she was preeminent '
must be buried in the chasm. M. Curtius, a Roman warrior, interpreted
this to mean ‘Valour and arms', and adorning his horse splendidly,
jumped in sull armour into the gulf, which closed over him.

‘procession’‚ with which the Circus games always began: it was half
