64 FAS TI. [Lm.

inauguration of Vesta is put in the second year of Numa (Romulus
reigning 38 years), acc. to the mythical chronology.

259. placidi, ‘peacesul'.

260. numinis, gen. aster meluenlius, acc. to the common use when
a part. is used as adj. (alieni appetens, servantissimus aequi, δια).

Livy says of Numa. (ι. 18), ‘dceply versed in human and divine
law'.

Sabina. Numa was a native of Cures in the Sabine country, 20 m.
N.E. of Rome.

261. videres, strictly used, ‘ you would have seen’.

The primitive shrine was a wicker-work hut thatched.

263. Vesta's round temple was just in front of the Palatine, and the
Regia in sront of that.

264. intonsi. Pliny says that shaving was introduced at Rome
300 Β. C. Scipio Africanus (VI. 234) is said to have been the first
Roman daily shaved. Hence the old Romans ale often called
intonsi.

266. causa probanda subest, ‘there is a reason that can be made
good’, ‘there is a cause to shew '.

268.. The MSS. here read: segnificam sedem terra ficusque suam,
which may be construed, ‘the earth and the fire mark their dwelling’,
i. e. Vesta, identified with earth, marks her dwelling (by the shape,
which resembles that of the earth) : and the fire, which belongs to both,
by being ever present in the temple.

But this is very intricate, and obscurely expressed, if that is the
meaning 3 and Ι have adopted Peter’s ingenious reading, sljgnificantque
deam tecta focusque suam ’‚ ‘the building (by its shape) and the fire are
the signs of their goddess’: a sense which keeps the same general con-
nection, and is much simpler and clearer.

271—278. A curious passage, which some people have rejected,
as it has been considered irrelevant, and 271—276 is wanting in many
MSS.

The omission from the MSS. however is easily explained, as 270 and
276 both end with onus, and the copyist, having written 270, might
easily carry on his eye by mistake to 277: a common source of error.
Moreover the sense is really quite intelligible and defensible.

The theory, dating from Anaxagoras, seems to have been that the
earth was a sphere in the centre of the universe, which itself revolved,
while the earth was stationary. Outside the earth were the spheres of
the other planets, revolving each round the same centre
