eutangled with the Roman idea of Matuta.

Ino, sister of Semele (who was beloved by Zeus, and became by him
mother of Bacchus), brought up the young child, and thus incurred the
anger of the jealous Here. The goddess drove Athamas (husband of
Ino, 489) mad, and he killed his son Lcarclzus (490), sancying him a lion
(489). Ino and lllelicerles (or Melicerta, 494), the other son, fied,
(Athamas also imagined them to be lions), and leaped in despair from a
rock on the isthmus of Corinth (495) into the sea. Panope and the
other sea-nymphs (499) received them, and they become sea-powers
under the new names of Leucothea and Palaemon (501).

This was the Greek story which Ovid adopts, but he makes the
end of it Roman again, thus :—The new sea-gods are led to the Tiber-
mouth3 they find (near the site of Rome) the Arcadian Evander
settled; and the women exeited to bacchic fury by Iuno attack the new

mother of Evander, the prophetie Carmentis, who recognises her3 and

she and her son are installed as Sea-gods of Rome under the Roman
names of Matuta and Portunus.

The 1 Jth of June was the festival of the Matralia, when the Matrons
went into this temple, with their sisters' children, not their own: no
slaves were admitted (481), except one, who was dismissed with a slap
in the sace. The real origin of these singular customs was no doubt
Latin and primitive, being a symbol of the feeling that children should
be the care of all matrons, and not of careless slaves.
