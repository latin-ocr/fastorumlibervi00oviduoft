676. i. e. ‘your palronus is coming‘.

XVhen a man wished to free (manu mittere) a slave, he brought him
to the magistrate and stated his wish. The lictor laid a rod upon the
slave’s head, pronounccd a form of words, and he was free. He then
became a libertus or freedman, and his late master was his patronus.
The patronus still had considerable claims sor service upon the freed-
man; which explains the (pretended) sright of the messenger when he

is said to be coming.
vindicta is the name of the rod used in this ceremony: and here by

a natural extension stands sor the ‘manumission’-

the body of the waggon is here wicker (scirpea).

70 5. concrjz't: the description is rather loose: for conctpt'o properly
means ‘to draw in, receive ’, as opposed to ‘emitting’3 and to this digitis

will not apply. The line is quite natural however: ‘with his fingers he
now lets out the air, now takes it in’.
