169. larda (prop. adj.)‚ ‘bacon ’.

172. ascitas, lit. ‘ setehed in ‘‚ so ‘ foreign ’. The luxurious tend-
ency of the wealtby Romans, which reached such a height in the first
century os the empire, was already satally apparent.

173. fraude, ‘ harm ’‚ its older meaning.

Fish was a great article ot* luxury in the empire. Juvenal (S. rv.) has a
famous mock-heroic account os ahuge turbot caught in Domitian’s reign,
which required a privy couneil to consider how to dispose and serve it up.

Oysters, too, were a great delicacy. In the same satire (140) we
read of a man who could tell at the first taste whether an oyster came
from Latium, Campania, or Britain.

175. The Ionian bird is the attagen, said to be the ‘god-wit' (a
longbilled wader).

176. The Pygmies (πυγμαΐοι, πυγ-, ‘men as big as a fist'‚ Tom-
Thumbs) werea sabulous dwarf-tace, os whom Homer tells us (Il. 111. 5)
that they lived on Oceanus (the water at the edge of the earth), and were
warred upon by the cranes; so this bird is the crane-

177. For afterwards his ssesh ‘ pleased ’ thern.

178. The MSS. reading here is ‘ miserat ante seras’, which is clearly
corrupt: sor as it stands it can only mean ‘the earth had till then not
given them snared game’‚ which is rather flat, where one expects the
mention of some special delicacy. Merkel's reading arte is an improve-
ment : the meaning being that the capture of game had not yet become
a regular skilled labour.

181. sextis A'akndis, on this day, 1 June, being the kalends of the
sixth mouth.

[183—196. 1 June, also the festival of Iuno Moneta on the Arx. It
stood where the house os Manlius had been (183—186) : happy had he
died when he saved the Capitol (187—190). Also the festival of Mars’
temple near Capena gate, and Tempestas (191—196).]

183. Temple of Iuno Moneta, vowed by F. Camillus (345 B.c.),
acc. to Livy (V11. 28), because ‘ he wanted the aid of the gods’ in a battle
with the Aurunci. Moneta means the ‘ adviser ' [moneo]. It afterwards

became the coining-establishment at Rome, and thus, curiously enough,
is the origin of the words ‘ mint ' and ‘ money '.

185. M. Manlius, besieged with the Romans in the Capitol by the
Gauls (390 B.c.)‚ was awoke (according to the famous story) by the
