[725—728. 19 June. The Sun passes from the Twins to the Crab
(signs of the Zodiac): F estival of Minerva on the Aventine.]

72 5. Elaborate expression for 13 days (we should say the 12th day)
before 1 July3 i.e. 19 June.

728. On the South side of the Aventine there was a temple of
Minerva of ancient date. Its exact site is unknown.

[729—762. 20 June. Commemoration of Temple of Summanus:
evening rising of the constellation of the Snake-holder3 and the story
of the same being set in the heavens‚ viz. how Aesculapius revived
Hippolytus, and was slain by Iuppiter but interceded for by Apollo]
