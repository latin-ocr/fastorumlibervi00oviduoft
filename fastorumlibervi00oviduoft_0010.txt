declaimer, but a bad pleader. He studied finally, like so many
of the educated Romans of the time, at Athens, where he
became an accomplished Greek scholar ; and afterwards travelled
in Asia and Sicily. He tells us himself that his bent was all for
poet1·y; and his chief friends were the poets of the time. He
was acquaintcd with Propertius, Gallus, Ponticus, Bassus, Macer,
and Horace. Vergil ‘he only just saw' (Trist. IV. 10. 51): for
Vergil spent his last years either at Naples or abroad, and died
when Ovid was only 24. He was appointed ajudge after his return
to Rome, and ultimately became one of the decemviri or Bench of
Ten who presided over certain trials. He divorced two wives and
appears to have married a third time more happily. He lived in
the best literary society at Rome, and enjoyed for several years
the friendship of Augustus. In A. D. 8 however, he offended the
court and was banished for the rest of his life to Tomi, a Greek
colony on the Euxine, in the Dobrudscha, that dreary region S.
of the Danube-mouths. The ostensible ground for this exile
was said to have been the immoral Love-poem (Ars Amatoria)
which he had published 10 years before. The real ground is
unknown : and in the absence of information has been supposed
to be some profligate intrigue. In his banishrnent he wrote the
Tristia and Letters from the Pontus, in which he gives the
most piteous account of the dangers and discomforts of his life
in that wretched country, interspersed with servile flattery of
Augustus and plaintive entreaties to his friends to get him
recalled. They, however, either did not try, or failed3 and he
died in exile A. D. 18.

Ovid began his poetic career with poems of love, in the
Elegiae metre, in which the elder poets Tibullus and Propertius
were already famous. But his chief model is said to have been
a Greek Parthenius, who was taken prisoner as a child in the
war with Mithridates (ended 63 Rc.) and who was set free at

v Rome on account of his talents. Ovid's first works were the
