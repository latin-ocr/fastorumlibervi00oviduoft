12 JNTRODUCTJON

The calendar was called ‘Fasti' because these days were
the most important. The subdivision of days was as follows :

Ι. Diessasti in general sense, ‘business days,' consisting of:

1. dies fasti in the special sense, as above ε marked F in
the Calendar.

2. dies comitiales, or days on which Senate or People
could be assembled. If there were no comitia,
then they became fasti proper. The nundinae or
mai-ket days, which fell every eighth (they said
nium) day were always Comitiales: but these
could not be marked in the calendar as they na-
turally were different each year: the other Co-
7722'liales were marked C.

11. Dies nefasti, days when no business could be done:

1. days marked NP, which were sacred to the gods.

2. days marked N‚-which were uniucky or ‘black' (atri).
Such were the days aster Calends, Nones and Ides.

III. Mixed days, as :—

1. days marked EN, intercisi (anciently endo=in) οι·
‘interrupted⁷ days.

2. days marked Q. R. C. F. or ‘qnando rex comitiavit
sas' ‘after the rex sacrificulus has been to the
forum, business may be done.'

3. the 15 June (see notes on 227) marked Q. ST. D. F.
or ‘qnando stercus delusum, sas,' ‘ when the dirt is
carried away, business may be done.'

See Ovid Ι. 45—60.
The above list is mainly from H. Peter⁷s edition.
