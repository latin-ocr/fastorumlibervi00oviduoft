201. Bellona, the goddess os war, had a temple in the Circus Fla-
minius (just. N. of the Capitol). It was vowed by Appius Claudius
the Blind (the great Censor. who built a great aqueduct and began the

· Appian way), ina sight with the Etruscans. Liv. x. ¹9·

duello, original form of ‘ bello ¹ (the v sound being hardened, and d

203. This refers to the famous scene in the senate, when Pyrrhus
(king of Epirus) had beaten the Romans at Heraclea (280 ss.C.) on the

when the old meaning had become lost or modified, was very strong
with the Romans. The pillar was called Columna Bellica, and the
