the stars, originally of course corresponded to the constella-
tions whence the names of the signs were taken. ln Ovid's
day they no longer did so. The error would assect other con-
stellations also.

Of this too he knows nothing.

5. Even the names of the constellations are occasionally
confused. Thus (lv. 904) he confuses Canis and Canicula.

6. To all these sources of error it is highly probable that
Ovid adds another, which might be the greatest of all : namely‚
that he at times is using older calculations without making the
necessary changes for the rey‘ormed calendar.

The references to astronomy in this book will bear out the con-
clusions thus arrived at. The following statements are made :

(1) Line 196. June 1. The eagle rises (he does not say whe-
ther morning or evening).

(2) „ 197. June 2. Hyades rise in the morning.

(3) „ 235. June 7. Arctophylax sets in the morning.

(4) ,‚ 469. June 10. Dolphin rises in the evening.

(5) ,, 711. June 15. Hyades rise in the morning.

(6) „ 719. June 16. Orion's arm rises in the evening.

(7) „ 720. June 17. Dolphin rises in the evening.

(8) ‚, 735. June 20. Ophiuchus rises in the evening.

(9) ,‚ 785. June 26. Orion's belt rises (he means probably)
in the morning.

We observe at once that two of these, the Hyades and the
Dolphin, are mentioned as rising twice, at the same time on two
different days, which is clearly impossible.

Let us take them in order :

(1) The rising referred to is the true evening one, and
the day is reglet.

(2) and (5). The apparent morning rising of the Hyades
was the 9th June : so (2) is seven days too soon, (5) is six days
too late. Both wrong.

(3) The apparent morning setting of Arcturus (the brightest
star in Arctophylax) is 10 June: as the whole constellation takes
some time to set, this is fairly right.
