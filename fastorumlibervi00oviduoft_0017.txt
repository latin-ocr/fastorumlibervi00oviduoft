We have seen that Julius Caesar-'s Calendar contained some
notices os the rising and setting of stars and constellations.
Such notices had been from the earliest times recorded in
Greece, where the climate permitted shepherds to be out with
their flocks all night, and where one of the earliest forms
of literature was the agricultural poem of Hesiod. After a
while rural almanacks began to be formed, and the phenomena
were observed with as much care as possible. At Rome the
process of intercalating the alternate years must have made
much more difficult the work of attaching special stars to
special days, as the irregularity of the civil calendar would
render such a work either very vague (allowing a margin of
several days) very complex (different for different years) or
altogether confused. We are not therefore surprised to find
that the Julian Calendar (by which intercalation was confined
to one day every four years) was made a new departure sor the
record of these astronomical observations. With care, the
record might have been very fairly accurate, and really useful.
Unfortunately however Ovid's purpose was far more literary
than scientific : and the poet was clearly not qualified, as Julius
Caesar had taken pains to qualify himself, for the astronomical
part of his work. XVhether, as some have arguedl, he derived
his notices of the stars chiefly from a contemporary student,
Clodius Tuscus, or whether he made indiscriminate use of
various and conflicting materials, it is not worth while to
decide, even if it were possible. The plain fact is that his
statements are ostener wrong than right : and the total result
to anyone who tried to make practical use of his tables must
have been confusion worse confounded.

It will not be difficult to make this clear, by shewing what
main sources of error there were, in speaking of the stars‚ to a
poet who was no astronomer.

1. It is necessary to distinguish the morning rising or
setting from the evem'ng rising or setting.
