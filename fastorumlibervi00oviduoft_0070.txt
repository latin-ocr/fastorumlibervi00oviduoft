299. vi stando Vesta, a very fancisul and of course impossible deri-
vation. The poets generally (and Ovid particularly) are fond of such
sancies: and in days before etymology the origin os words was not felt
to be a question os fact, but a sair subject sor ingenuity and imagination.
(So Plato gives ἔρα-ς srom ἐρρωμένος, ἵμερος srom ἰόντα μέρη, &c.). Com·
pare 301, 303. See 140.

300. i. e. Ἐστία from ἑστάναι, ‘to stand’.

301. Ovid is more fortunate with this etymology: sor probably
so-cus and so-veo are connected [FA- or Ρᾼν- ‘ bright ’‚ so ‘ warin ’].

302. tamen here is almost: ‘by the way’: it is opposed to some-
thing understood ‘ (though now in the interior of the house), yet then’‚ &c.

303. vestibulum, another fancy derivation. The real origin is
probably VAS· ‘to dwell ’.

304. praefizmur ‘first address‘: orig. a Greek custorn, to begin with
vesta.

up on a firm base with a hollow cone fitting over it. This top stone had
a sunnel shaped hole in the top down which the corn was put: the
upper stone was then turned and the corn ground between the surfaces.
It was made of various hard stones, sometimes a kind oslava (pumiceas,
318). It was, of course, rough (scabra) to do its work.

313. sola far-ra (not bread, but), ‘simple spelt ': the earliest sood os
the rustic Romans being patched spelt. Madvig, however, ingeniously
suggests lota or selda (solida): since sola is unlikely.
