563. In 90 B.C. the Social war, as it is called, broke out. Many of
the Italian tribes (or ¹ allies ' of Rome), the Marsi, Peligni, Samnites, &c.‚
revolted because the Senate refused to listcn to their grievances. The
consul P. Rutilius Lupus was defeated and killed on the Liris (accord-

573. dea. The goddess Fortune (usually blind, 576) was said to
