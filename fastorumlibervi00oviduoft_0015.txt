intercalary month! Thus the year 46 contained 445 days, and
is fitly called by Macrobius ‘the last year of confusion) For the
future Caesar dispenscd with the intercalary mouth, distributing
ten days among the seven months which had only had 29, viz.
Jan. Apr. June, Aug. Sept. Nov. giving two to Jan. Aug. and
Dec„ and the rest one. This made the year 365 days long,
about a quarter of a day too short: and this latter error he
remedied by the intercalation of one day after Feb. 23 every
fourth year. It was placed there, and not at the end, because
the last five days were regarded in some way as extra to t'ne
year; the 23 Feb. being the Terminalia or Last Day, as the
15t March had always been New year's dayl. This is our ”
present arrangement, except that we count the 29th as the inter-
calary day.

It should be mentioned that there was still an error in the
Julian calculation‚ which estimated the solar year at 3652}- days;
sor this is really in excess of the true year by more than 1 1 minutes.
Caesar either was unaware of this, or he thought it might be dis-
regarded. But as time went on, the error accumulated‚ and in
1582 it had amounted to 13 days. Pope Gregory X111 again
reformed the calendar, striking out ten of the thirteen days, and
arranging to avoid the error for the future by leaving out three
leap-years in every four centuries. Thus 1700, 1800, and 1900
are not kap-years, but 2000 is ; and so on. This arrangement is
known as the N ew Style‚ and was adopted in England in 1752.

Dies fasti were properly ‘Speaking-days ' or days on which
the praetor could ‘speak,' (i.e. could use the three legal words
‘do‚ dico, addico,' ‘I give, pronounce‚ award’) and so, days
on which legal business could be carried on.

¹ In the leap-year, accordingly, the old days' names were kept, the
25th being (as the 24th was usually) a. d. VI. Kal. Mart, and the 24th
in this year was a„ d. VI. Kal. Mart. posterior, the other being prior.
Thus there were two sexli or 6th days, and hence the term Bissextile.
